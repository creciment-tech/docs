## Welcome to Chidori

Chidori is a delivery logistics platform that enables you to integrate delivery services directly into your applications. Our Enterprise API provides programmatic access to pricing, delivery creation, payments, and real-time tracking.

## API Environments

Chidori provides two separate environments for development and production:

| Environment | Base URL | Purpose |
|-------------|----------|---------|
| **Sandbox** | `https://sandbox.chidori.africa` | Testing and development |
| **Live** | `https://api.chidori.africa` | Production traffic |

<Tip>
  Start with the sandbox environment to test your integration without affecting real deliveries or wallet balances.
