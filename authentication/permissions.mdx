description: "Configure granular permissions for your Chidori API keys"

## Overview

Chidori API keys support granular permissions, allowing you to control exactly what each key can do. This follows the principle of least privilege—only grant the permissions your application actually needs.

## Available permissions

| Permission | Description | Required for |
|------------|-------------|--------------|
| `pricing:read` | Get delivery price estimates | `/api/pricing/single`, `/api/pricing/bulk` |
| `delivery:create` | Create new deliveries | `/api/deliveries/create`, `/api/deliveries/create-bulk` |
| `delivery:read` | View delivery details | `/api/deliveries/get`, `/api/deliveries/list` |
| `payment:create` | Process payments | `/api/payments/charge` |
| `payment:read` | View transaction history | `/api/payments/list-transactions`, `/api/payments/get-transaction` |
| `webhook:manage` | Manage webhooks | `/api/webhooks/*` |
| `location:read` | Access real-time location | WebSocket location updates |

## Permission groups

For convenience, you can think of permissions in logical groups:

### Pricing permissions
```
pricing:read
```
Required to calculate delivery costs before creating deliveries.

### Delivery permissions
```
delivery:create
delivery:read
```
- `delivery:create` - Create single or bulk deliveries
- `delivery:read` - View and list your deliveries

### Payment permissions
```
payment:create
payment:read
```
- `payment:create` - Charge wallet for deliveries
- `payment:read` - View transaction history

### Webhook permissions
```
webhook:manage
```
Full control over webhook configuration.

### Location permissions
```
location:read
```
Required for WebSocket real-time tracking.

## Common permission sets

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Full access (all permissions)">
    For development and testing, or when your application needs complete API access:
    
    ```json
    [
      "pricing:read",
      "delivery:create",
      "delivery:read",
      "payment:create",
      "payment:read",
      "webhook:manage",
      "location:read"
    ]
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="E-commerce integration">
    For an online store that creates and pays for deliveries:
    
    ```json
    [
      "pricing:read",
      "delivery:create",
      "delivery:read",
      "payment:create"
    ]
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Tracking dashboard">
    For a dashboard that only displays delivery status:
    
    ```json
    [
      "delivery:read",
      "location:read"
    ]
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Reporting system">
    For a system that generates reports on deliveries and payments:
    
    ```json
    [
      "delivery:read",
      "payment:read"
    ]
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Pricing calculator">
    For a tool that only calculates delivery prices:
    
    ```json
    [
      "pricing:read"
    ]
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Setting permissions

When creating an API key through the dashboard:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to API Keys">
    Go to [chidori.africa/dashboard](https://chidori.africa/dashboard) and open the API Keys section.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create new key">
    Click **Create API Key**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select permissions">
    Check the boxes for each permission you want to grant. You can select individual permissions or use preset groups.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create the key">
    Click **Create** to generate your key with the selected permissions.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Permission errors

When you attempt an action without the required permission, you receive a `403 Forbidden` response:

<ResponseExample>
```json 403 Forbidden
{
  "status": false,
  "message": "Missing required permission: delivery:create"
}
```
</ResponseExample>

## Best practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Least privilege" icon="shield-check">
    Only grant permissions that are actually needed. This limits damage if a key is compromised.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Separate keys by function" icon="key">
    Create different keys for different parts of your application, each with only the permissions it needs.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Audit regularly" icon="magnifying-glass">
    Periodically review your API keys and their permissions. Revoke unused keys.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Document key usage" icon="file-lines">
    Keep track of which keys are used where in your infrastructure.
