## Overview

Chidori provides two separate environments to help you develop and test your integration before going live. Each environment is completely isolated with its own data, wallets, and API keys.

## Environment comparison

| Feature | Sandbox | Live |
|---------|---------|------|
| **Base URL** | `https://sandbox.chidori.africa/enterprise-service` | `https://api.chidori.africa/enterprise-service` |
| **API Key Prefix** | `sk_sandbox_` | `sk_live_` |
| **Real Deliveries** | No | Yes |
| **Real Payments** | No (test wallet) | Yes (real wallet) |
| **Driver Assignment** | Simulated | Real drivers |
| **Webhooks** | Fully functional | Fully functional |

## Sandbox environment

The sandbox environment is designed for development and testing. Use it to:

- Test your integration without affecting real deliveries
- Experiment with different API flows
- Test webhook integrations
- Train your team on the API

### Sandbox base URL

```
https://sandbox.chidori.africa/enterprise-service
```

### Sandbox API keys

Sandbox API keys start with `sk_sandbox_`:

```
sk_sandbox_7c9aa6f0-0f62-4bb2-a3aa-6c7bbf7b9a1a.aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
```

### Test wallet

In sandbox mode, you have access to a test wallet that you can fund with any amount through the [Chidori Dashboard](https://chidori.africa/dashboard):

1. Go to the **Wallet** section in your dashboard
2. Select your sandbox environment
3. Click **Fund Wallet** and enter any amount
4. The funds are added instantly at no cost

<Tip>
  You can reset your sandbox wallet to the default balance of ₦100,000 from the dashboard at any time.
</Tip>

### Sandbox limitations

- Deliveries are not dispatched to real drivers
- Location updates are simulated (WebSocket not available)
- No real-world delivery tracking
- Data may be periodically cleared

## Live environment

The live environment handles real deliveries with real drivers and real payments.

### Live base URL

```
https://api.chidori.africa/enterprise-service
```

### Live API keys

Live API keys start with `sk_live_`:

```
sk_live_7c9aa6f0-0f62-4bb2-a3aa-6c7bbf7b9a1a.aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
```

<Warning>
  Live API keys process real transactions. Keep them secure and never expose them in client-side code.
</Warning>

### Going live checklist

Before switching to the live environment, ensure you have:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Test thoroughly in sandbox">
    Complete all your integration testing in the sandbox environment.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create live API keys">
    Generate new API keys with mode set to **Live** from your dashboard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Update your base URL">
    Change your API base URL from `sandbox.chidori.africa` to `api.chidori.africa`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fund your live wallet">
    Add funds to your live wallet through the dashboard or bank transfer.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure webhooks">
    Update your webhook URL if needed for production.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monitor your first deliveries">
    Watch your first few live deliveries closely to ensure everything works as expected.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Switching between environments

To switch between environments, you need to:

1. **Change the base URL** in your API client
2. **Use the appropriate API key** (sandbox or live)

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Node.js
const CHIDORI_BASE_URL = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'
  ? 'https://api.chidori.africa/enterprise-service'
  : 'https://sandbox.chidori.africa/enterprise-service';

const CHIDORI_API_KEY = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'
  ? process.env.CHIDORI_LIVE_KEY
  : process.env.CHIDORI_SANDBOX_KEY;
```

```python Python
import os

CHIDORI_BASE_URL = (
    'https://api.chidori.africa/enterprise-service'
    if os.environ.get('ENV') == 'production'
    else 'https://sandbox.chidori.africa/enterprise-service'
)

CHIDORI_API_KEY = (
    os.environ.get('CHIDORI_LIVE_KEY')
    if os.environ.get('ENV') == 'production'
    else os.environ.get('CHIDORI_SANDBOX_KEY')
)
```
</CodeGroup>

## Best practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Use environment variables" icon="lock">
    Never hardcode API keys. Use environment variables to manage keys for different environments.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Test webhooks in sandbox" icon="webhook">
    Set up and test your webhook handlers in sandbox before going live.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Separate API keys" icon="key">
    Create separate API keys for sandbox and live. Never mix them.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Monitor live usage" icon="chart-line">
    Keep an eye on your live API usage and wallet balance.
